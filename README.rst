Artificial Intelligence Tool Kit Mark Two.
------------------------------------------


* Free software: Apache Software License 2.0
* Documentation: https://aitools.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* N-GRAM

    * Predict the next word of the sentence that further can be use for predicting the entire sentence.
    * Generation of text like a paragraph/article on Health or environment or any other topic (given relevant data).
    * Generation of the next GOT books!!!.

    * Next Phase - Use of bayesian statistics and more nice probability models for getting the best results.

Look For: Demo file n_gram.py

* K-MEANS

    * Creates clusters and classify new nodes into those clusters.
    * Efficient and easy to implement.

    * Next Phase - Multiple algorithms implementation.

Look For: Demo file k_means.py and k_means_color_cluster.py

* Logistic Regression

    * From probability of event happening or not to the next Data point, it is a very versatile algorithm.
    * Simple Implementation and Training routines.
    * Uses Gradient Descent and Sigmoid Function.

    * Next Phase - Improvements in Gradient Descent is still in progress.

Look For: Demo file logistic_regression.py

* Naive Bayes

    * Algorithm based on Bayesian statistics, which is capable of creating classifications like an intent classifier or sentiment analysis engine(A true complex one not the Pathetic Twitter thing).
    * Created using little bit of probability and bayesian statistics with a hint of programming and with a lot of love.

    * Next Phase - Flexibility and more control on different algorithm.

Look For: Demo file naive_bayes.py

* Pre Processing

    * Utils for Pre Processing Data.

    * Next Phase - More Cool Functions.

Look For: Demo file pre_processing.py

* Others

    * In build Mathematics Util.
        * Vector Math, Probability, and some Statistic
        * Util will be upgraded as per the need.
    * Gradient Descent.
        * Entire Gradient Descent algorithm combined into one.
        * Usability Docs will be Provided Soon.

* Updates

    * Working on Support Vector Machines.
        * Lot of Maths!!!
